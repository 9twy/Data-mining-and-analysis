# **Data Mining and Analysis Project**

## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing, visualizing, and extracting insights from a dataset using various **data mining** and **machine learning techniques**. The work includes preprocessing data, exploring relationships, implementing clustering methods, and applying decision tree algorithms using libraries like **sklearn**. Advanced visualization techniques are employed to interpret results effectively.

## **Key Features and Steps**

### **1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration**
- **Null Values Check**: Identified and handled missing values in the dataset.
- **Normalization**: Standardized the dataset to ensure uniform scales for better analysis.

### **2. Data Visualization**
- Visualized the dataset to understand patterns, distributions, and outliers using:
   - Scatter plots
   - Heatmaps
   - Correlation matrices

### **3. Statistical Measures**
- Calculated **Euclidean Distance** to measure similarity between data points.
- Computed **Entropy** to evaluate uncertainty or information gain in the dataset.

### **4. Correlation Matrix**
- Implemented and visualized the **correlation matrix** to identify relationships between variables and explore multicollinearity.

## **5. Decision Tree Implementation**
Using the **`sklearn`** library, decision tree algorithms were applied for classification and decision-making tasks:
- **CART Algorithm** (Classification and Regression Trees)
- **Hunt's Algorithm** for structured and efficient tree generation.

## **6. Clustering Techniques**

### **K-Means Clustering**  
- Performed clustering on the dataset and visualized clusters using **scatter plots**.  
- Determined the **optimal number of clusters** using the **Elbow Method** and visualized results with a **SEE chart**.

### **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- Implemented hierarchical clustering and visualized the **dendrogram** to understand cluster formation.
